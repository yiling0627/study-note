##Webpack
<font color="red"><em><b>Webpack is a module bundler</b></em></font>. 		
The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, and it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging  any other resource (like typescript, Scss) which can not run directly on the browser.

##Gulp -- ÂâçÁ´ØÊûÑÂª∫Â∑•ÂÖ∑
<font color="red"><b><em>Gulp is a structure tool</em></b>, </font>it can be used for doing some optimization things, like merge or compress the code, test the code and the most important one is watch the whole project which means when you change something spicific, it will automatically change it and refresh the browser.

##<font color="" size="4">Difference between Webpack & Gulp(Grunt)	</font>	
####Gulp and Grunt:		
in config file, you set up how to compile, compress, or merge on some specific files, and then 
gulp will do all the things for you automatically.

####Webpack:	
webpack takes your project as a whole thing.		
And through a given index.js file, webpack will search for all the dependen
t files, deal with all these files using loaders. finally bundle them which can be identified by the browser.

webpack is more convenient and faster, can bundle different kinds of files.
